## MARKET SEGMENTATION FOR EV


## INTRODUCTION
This project is all about helping a new electric vehicle (EV) startup figure out how to enter the Indian market. Instead of just diving in blindly, we're going to take a close look at what's already happening in the market. We'll use data from different places to understand what kinds of cars people prefer, how they decide to buy them, and how many are already choosing electric vehicles. By doing this, we'll find out which groups of people are most likely to be interested in buying our EVs. This way, the startup can focus its efforts on the right customers and have a better chance of success in the Indian market.

## KEY FINDINGS
